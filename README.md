How to get started with College Score!

The United State Department of Education publishes data annually covering many attributes of higher learning educational
e.g., universities, colleges, etc. This data can be found on this website: https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/

This application takes a small subset of the data covering universities and colleges in the state of California and provides 
an interface for searching by admission rates and a few special attributes: 

* Asian American Native American Pacific Islander-serving institution
* Hispanic-serving institution
* Women-only college

Based on this search criteria a map is displayed showing all of the universities that match this criteria. 

** Please note ** - it takes a few seconds for the file to be read and processed and before the map is initially
rendered. 

The application uses the leaflet library for presenting maps.
